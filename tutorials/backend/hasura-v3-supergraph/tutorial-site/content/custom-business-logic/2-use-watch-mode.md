## Activate dev mode {#activate-dev-mode}

From the root directory of our project, run the following command to re-activate dev mode:

```bash
ddn dev
```

## Test the connector on Hasura DDN {#test-connector}

You can create the following mutation and test it out in the Console after your build completes:

```graphql
mutation app_ sample_hello {
  hello
}
```

This will return the string "hello world" as expected ðŸŽ‰

You can also explore your supergraph and see the new `hello` mutation in the Explorer:
