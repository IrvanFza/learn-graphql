You can use this course by watching the videos and reading, but you can also
[clone the finished repo](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-typescript-learn-course) to see it in action straight away
too. Also to follow along from a skeleton project, clone the repo and checkout the  `follow-along` branch:

```shell
# If using SSH
git clone git@github.com:hasura/ndc-typescript-learn-course.git
# If HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/hasura/ndc-typescript-learn-course.git
```

```shell
git checkout follow-along
```

```shell
npm install
```
